				I worked in the Cloud Security team, where my contributions focused on protecting and strengthening our cloud infrastructure. 
				I developed a proof of concept for runtime protection across Verafin's AWS ECS instances, leveraging AWS GuardDuty and Prisma Cloud Defender 
				to assess security coverage, deployment feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, I conducted penetration testing on these tools to 
				evaluate and enhance their security protections. To reinforce access security, I implemented the PoLP for IAM 
				users accessing resources like S3 buckets. My work also involved configuring and managing IAM policies, permission boundaries, and SCPs
				to ensure secure and controlled access across our cloud environment.
